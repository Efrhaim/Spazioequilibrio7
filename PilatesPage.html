                The goal then, as now, finds an answer to the question "what is
                Pilates for?".
              </p>
              <p>
                Pilates allows the body, through movement and mental harmony, to
                perform daily movements with ease.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pilates is a philosophy of life, a discipline that puts the
                well-being of the person first.

                sensations, making it part of our existence. It is a combination
                of breath, concentration, control, precision.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each exercise requires concentration and through concentration
                each lesson takes you away from a thousand thoughts and worries.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pilates exercises are also performed with the support of some
                tools. They are small tools that increase the effectiveness of
                Pilates exercises and help the body. Pilates is useful and
                suitable for everyone.
