                        <p>Shiatsu is an ancient Japanese art , a natural and gentle discipline full of potential.</p>

                        <p>The goal of Shiatsu treatment is to act on body and mind to restore a correct psychophysical
                            balance.</p>

                        <h3>Shiatsu treatments: key points</h3>

                        <p>Among the key points of Shiatsu treatment there are: favoring the conditions for the recovery
                            of a natural well-being , awakening and harmonizing the vital functions and helping the body
                            to discover its own resources and re-elaborate external stimuli.</p>

                        <p>It operates in the holistic vision of the individual, promoting greater awareness in relation
                            to himself, his lifestyle and the environment that surrounds him.</p>

                        <p>It adapts to any individual of any age and physical structure.</p>

                        <p>The key concept for which to undergo a Shiatsu treatment is that of the prevention of certain
                            pains or disorders.</p>

                        <h1>Is Shiatsu dangerous?</h1>
                        <p>Shiatsu is the evolutionary discipline for those who care about maintaining good physical
                            health and want to take time for themselves and dedicate themselves to their well-being.</p>

                        <p>This is why Shiatsu is not dangerous.</p>

                        <p>Before each treatment, Spazio Balance 7 evaluates your physical condition and listens to your
                            wishes in order to perform a targeted and absolutely safe treatment!</p>

                        <p>The sensations after a Shiatsu treatment are subjective and depending on your psycho-physical
                            situation. The most frequent sensations after a Shiatsu treatment are: feeling of
                            well-being, reduction of tension, state of relaxation and harmony.</p>

                        <p>However, sensations must be linked to all the benefits that Shiatsu treatments performed
                            consistently can bring.</p>
