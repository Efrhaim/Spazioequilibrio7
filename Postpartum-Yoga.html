                “ The moment a child is born, the mother is also born. She has
                never existed before. There was the woman, but never the mother.
                A mother is something absolutely new.” Osho

                After giving birth, yoga practice can be resumed after about 6-8
                weeks. At the beginning , pelvic floor exercises and some gentle
                exercises will be performed to allow your body to gradually
                resume physical activity. balance space 7 will receive you in a
                well-kept, welcoming and safe environment in which to practice
                Yoga in peace. You will be followed by Giselle who has been
                professionally trained for this practice and will be able to
                support you in carrying out the exercises, respecting your body
                and her movements.
