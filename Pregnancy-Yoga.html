                        <h2>Can you practice yoga while pregnant?</h2>

                        <p>This is the question that many pregnant women ask themselves , eager to be able to practice
                            gentle physical activity that also benefits their current condition.</p>

                        <p>Yoga practiced during pregnancy has no contraindications.</p>

                        <p>It is possible to practice it from the thirteenth week of gestation. Many women approach Yoga
                            right in the prepartum period and then initially continue with a postpartum course .</p>

                        <p>â€œThe moment you started practicing yoga regularly, you took a very important step towards
                            positive living. You have made the conscious choice to dedicate some of your time to
                            nourishing yourself, in body and spirit, a useful fact every moment of life, which becomes
                            fundamental when you are expecting a child and your body represents the very first place,
                            the primary environment, in which it must grow.
